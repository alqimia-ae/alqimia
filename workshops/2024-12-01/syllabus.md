## Get Started Early
There is time set aside to do the following during our session, but feel free to get started ahead of time. 

* Create a GitHub Account
    * GitHub is used for hosting and sharing code, and is the website you're currently reading this document from.
* Create Replit Account
    * We will use Replit as a web-based runner for our programs as we explore Elixir. This is useful because it allows us to get immediate and shareable results without havin to deal with local environment setup, which can be troublesome at times
* Listen to [The Soul of Elixir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvBT4XBdoUE) by Saša Jurić
* (Stretch) Read sections 1 and 2 of [Out of the Tar Pit](https://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf) by Moseley and Marks
